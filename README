================

This is the repository for the source code for the Android app Find Your First Linux Distro

This app is based on the fragments tutorial at:
http://bradipao.blogspot.com/2012/03/fragment-tutorial-part-2.html

Given landscape mode, this tutorial app has two halves.  A menu consisting of two buttons
(Send Text to Fragment or Send Text to Activity) occupies the left half of the screen.  A
text message stating which button you most recently pressed ("Text From Fragment" or "Text
From Activity" occupies the right half of the screen.  In portrait mode, only the menu half
is visible initially, and the view switches to the status portion when you press a button.

HOW THE FRAGMENTS TUTORIAL WORKS

res/layout/ac_main.xml: landscape orientation; layout consisting of the menu fragment and the
    status fragment
res/layout-port/ac_main.xml: portrait orientation; layout consisting of the menu fragment and
    the status fragment
ac_body.xml: layout consisting of just the status fragment
fr_body.xml: layout of the fragment displaying the status
fr_menu.xml: layout of the fragment displaying the menu

JanusActivity.java: main activity; displays ac_main.xml layout;
    Calls MenuFragment class
    If the status section has not been filled in, calls BodyActivity class; otherwise,
        changes the text in the status section
MenuFragment.java: contains the responses to clicking on the buttons - "Text From Fragment" or
    "Text From Activity"
BodyActivity.java:
    Portrait mode: displays just the status half of the screen
    Changes the text in the status section
BodyFragment.java: changes the text in the status section



ac_main.xml -> main2.xml
ac_body.xml -> main2_questions.xml
fr_body.xml -> fragment_answer.xml
fr_menu.xml -> fragment_questions.xml

ac_main.xml -> main2.xml
ac_body.xml -> main2_questions.xml
fr_body.xml -> fragment_answer.xml
fr_menu.xml -> fragment_questions.xml

HOW FIND YOUR FIRST LINUX DISTRO WORKS

main2.xml: layout for tablet screens and landscape mode
main2_questions.xml: layout for smartphones and portrait mode
fragment_questions.xml: layout containing the questions
fragment_answer.xml: layout containing the answer
